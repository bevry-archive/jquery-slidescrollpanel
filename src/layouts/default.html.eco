			<strong><%= @package.title %></strong> is a great way to <%= @package.description.substring(0,1).toLowerCase()+@package.description.substring(1) %>

		<ul class="features">
			<li><strong>Extremely simple to use:</strong> just call <code>$('#element).ScrollTo()</code> and your user will be smoothly scrolled to that element!</li>
			<li><strong>Only 1KB in size!</strong> Making it the smallest ScrollTo plugin and won't slow you down.</li>
			<li><strong>Supports all the elements you can throw at it!</strong> Even those ones in modals and scrollable areas! So you can now feel at ease knowing your user will always be scrolled to that correct place which you intended.</li>
			<li><strong>It's even easy customise and work with!</strong> You can specify such options as <code>duration</code>, <code>easing</code>, and <code>callback</code> on your ScrollTo call.</li>
		</ul>

		<p>Enough talk, let's see it in action!</p>

		<h3>Step 1. <a href="<%= @package.download %>" title="Download">Download</a> <%= @package.title %>, and extract it to your hard drive</h3>
		<div>
			As everyones extraction process is a little bit different be sure of the following:
			<ul class="install">
				<li>If the archive was extracted and you have a whole bunch of files and directories (folders), then you must create a new directory called <code><%= @package.name %></code> and move all the files and directories into that to continue.</li>
				<li>If the archive was extracted and you have only one directory called <code><%= @package.name %></code> which has a whole bunch of stuff in it, then that is fine and you can continue onto the next step.</li>
				<li>If the archive was extracted and you have only one directory and it is not called <code><%= @package.name %></code> then you must rename it to <code><%= @package.name %></code> to continue.</li>
			</ul>
		</div>

		<h3>Step 2. Move the <code><%= @package.name %></code> directory to somewhere on your webserver</h3>
		<p>Be sure to always keep the entire <code><%= @package.name %></code> directory intact; this means if you were to only move some of the files instead of moving the entire directory, then you would run into problems due to the cross directory references would no longer be working.</p>

		<h3>Step 3. Include jQuery (insert into your page's head tag)</h3>
		<p>If your page already has jQuery included then you can skip this step.</p>
		<pre><code class="language-html">
			&lt;!-- Include jQuery (Dependency of <%= @package.title %>) --&gt;
			&lt;script src="http://www.yoursite.com/somewhere/on/your/webserver/<%= @package.name %>/vendor/jquery.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
		</code></pre>

		<h3>Step 4. Include <%= @package.title %> (insert into your page's head tag)</h3>
		<pre><code class="language-html">
			&lt;!-- Include <%= @package.title %> --&gt;
			&lt;script src="http://www.yoursite.com/somewhere/on/your/webserver/<%= @package.name %>/lib/<%= @package.name %>.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
		</code></pre>
